  "rdfs:comment": "Gel sample #6 from Sortase growth (3.56 g) was resuspended in 17.5 mL of BugBuster solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe suspension was cleared by centrifugation (SS34, 20krpm, 25', 4 C).\r\n\r\nThe cleared lysate was (eventually) loaded onto a 1 mL Nickel column. Flow through was collected (5 mL fractions) and the column washed in Tris-HCl pH 8 150 mM KCl 10 mM imidazole until absorbance returned to baseline. The column was eluted in the same buffer with 300 mM imidazole.\r\n\r\nFlow through fractions 1-15. Elution fractions 16-\r\n\r\nPeak in fractions 17/18.",
