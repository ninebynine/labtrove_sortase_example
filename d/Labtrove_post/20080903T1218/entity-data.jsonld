The tubes were examined and to those tubes where the solid had completely dissolved (boc-Gly and vanillin) further solid was added followed by 30s vortexing until residual solid was observed.\r\n\r\nThe full log of the experiment is available at:\r\n\r\nhttp://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/exp207\r\n",
